<h2 id="dev">Development</h2>
    <p>The origins of Fallout: New Vegas date back to the cancellation of Van Buren, which was intended to be the third game in the mainline Fallout series. Under the development of Black Isle Studios, Van Buren was to be set in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Utah, and would have included a mixture of real-time and turn-based combat. Black Isle Studios' publisher Interplay Entertainment was struggling financially, and in December 2003 Van Buren was cancelled<p> Prior to the project's cancellation, former Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment employees cofounded Obsidian Entertainment. Over the next few years, Obsidian developed the role-playing games Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Neverwinter Nights 2, and Alpha Protocol.

        In 2007, Bethesda Softworks purchased the Fallout intellectual property. </p> <p> following year they released Fallout 3. Fallout 3 was well received by critics, and sold more than 5 million copies in 2008. Prior to the release of Fallout 3, Bethesda had already begun development on what would become The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Bethesda wanted to support Fallout 3 with more content, and decided to contract another developer to create a large expansion pack. Bethesda creative director Todd Howard successfully lobbied for a full game instead of an expansion pack, and suggested Obsidian based on their experience with the Fallout series. Obsidian had previously turned down an offer from Bethesda in 2007 to develop a Star Trek game, but agreed to develop a spin-off game to the main Fallout series. </p>
        



<p><h2>Additional Fact</h2></p>
<p>While developing Bethesda told Obsidian that in order for them to get royalties for the game and get payed that the game would need a 85 on Metacritic. The game ended up getting a 84 and they didnt get payed even though its only a point below. And to make it worse a lot of fans consider this to be the best Fallout game in the series and only got a low rating from the rough launch it had which only happened beacause of the short deadline.</p>

<h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay.</h3>
<p>Fallout: New Vegas is an action role-playing game that can be played from either a first-person or third-person perspective. It is set in the Mojave Desert, years after a nuclear war left much of the United States decimated. The player controls a courier who survived an assassination attempt from an unknown assailant. The goal of the game is to complete a series of quests to find the assailant, which eventually culminates in a war between different governing factions vying for control of the Mojave Desert.  In addition to the main quests, the player can participate in optional unrelated quests known as side quests. Kristinie Stiemer of IGN estimates that it takes around 100 hours to complete every quest in the game.

    <p>the beginning of the game, the player can customize the couriers physical appearance by choosing their gender, age, and race. They can then allocate points into seven primary attributes: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck. These attributes are known as S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, and range from 1 to 10. Additionally, there are 13 secondary attributes whose point totals are affected by S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats: barter, energy weapons, explosives, guns, lockpick, medicine, melee weapons, repair, science, sneak, speech, survival, and unarmed. 
        <p>the player has a high intelligence stat for example, then they will be more proficient with the medicine, repair, and science skills at the beginning of the game. The player can add more points into skill stats whenever they earn enough experience points to level up.
     Experience points can be earned through several methods, such as killing an enemy or completing a quest. When the player reaches an even-numbered level, they can select a perk, which is a permanent beneficial upgrade. For example, the perk Rapid Reload increases the reload speed for guns by 25 percent. Fallout: New Vegas features an open world map that the player can freely explore. 
        </p>
    <p> the player can discover range from small settlements and abandoned buildings, to larger locations like the Hoover Dam and the city of New Vegas, which was built from the remnants of Las Vegas. The player is equipped with a wearable computer called the Pip-Boy 3000.The device serves as a menu, and allows the player to access items they have acquired, view detailed character statistics and active quests, and look at the map.The player can use the Pip-Boy 3000 map to fast travel to previously discovered locations. The player can also use the Pip-Boy 3000 as a radio, and listen songs from the 1940s to the early 1960s on makeshift radio broadcasts.<p> While exploring, the player can recruit some non-player characters as companions, who will accompany the player and assist them in combat. There are a variety of weapons in the game, including standard guns, energy-based guns, melee weapons, and explosives. While in combat, the player can utilize a gameplay mechanic known as V.A.T.S., which pauses the game and allows the player to target specific body parts of an enemy. V.A.T.S. is dictated by a statistic known as Action Points. Each attack while in V.A.T.S. costs Action Points, and when the player runs out of Action Points they must wait a short period of time before they can use it again.</p>

<h3 id="setting">Setting.</h3>
<p>Fallout: New Vegas takes place in the year 2281, 204 years after a devastating nuclear war between the United States and China, known as the Great War. Three major entities seek control of the Mojave Desert, known in-game as the Mojave Wasteland: The New California Republic (NCR), a democratic republic that attempts to maintain law; Caesar's Legion, a violent tribal army inspired by the Roman legion; and Mr. House, a mysterious businessman from New Vegas who controls an army of robots called securitrons. As part of an eastward expansion from California, the NCR took control of the Hoover Dam, which provides electricity to the surrounding area. Caesar's Legion and Mr. House each want to control the Hoover Dam for themselves and advance their own plans for the region. Along with the three main factions, minor ones include; the Boomers, a heavily armed xenophobic tribe at Nellis Air Force Base; the Powder Gangers, escaped convicts from a correctional facility; the Great Khans, a tribe of drug dealers; and the Brotherhood of Steel, a militant organization who aim to secure old technology.</p>
